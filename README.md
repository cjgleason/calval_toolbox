**SWORD inputs:**
- SWORD data in the netCDF format brought in at the continental scale with centerline, node, and reach data. See the [SWORD Explorer](https://www.swordexplorer.com) for links to detailed dataset documentation.
- Domain csv file containing all SWORD reaches and nodes of interest.

**Initializing the toolboxes**

The river toolboxes are run on one field campaign at a time. First, the river of interest needs to be defined, along with the hubname associated with it (e.g. UC, UMass, UNC), the corresponding PT_key_file(s), utm_zone, and continent. A reach_end_buffer (which 'extends' reaches) and scale_maxwidth (how many SWORD widths wide each node box is) are also defined.

Empty directories named by processing date are created to store munged data outputs for PTs, GNSS drifts, and integrated SWORD products in addition to directories created for quality control flagged PT and GNSS drift output data. Depending on the reprocess_switch, dataframes may just be appended with additional data (0) or all reach and node products are recreated if there are major updates to toolbox processing (1). The directories are:
- Munged drifts/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd
- Munged PT/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd
- Data frames/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd
- Flagged PT/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd
- Flyby PT/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd

## Creating data frames from GNSS drifts

- First, list all the GNSS files returned from JPL processing that match the river of interest. There might be 'bad' duplicates of GNSS files, so filter by version date to pull in the most recent files.

- Run the create_GNSS_dataframe function. The function reads in the netCDF GNSS drifts sourced from PO.DAAC and creates a data frame in an xml format for cleaning and quality flagging with the fields listed in the GNSS inputs pulled in.

- Event code times are converted to POSIXct UTC. A one-minute buffer is added to the start and end time of the event codes that are powerlines or bridges.

- All of the GNSS TAI times format are converted to POSIXct UTC. Only data with the surface flag of 12 (water) and motion code of 2 (moving) are kept. Data with an uncertainty (position_3drss_formal_error) greater than 5cm are filtered out.

- ***Special case*** The Waimakariri River has static GNSS PT install files that need to be retained with a motion code of 0 (static). For just the Waimak, check if the GNSS file is listed in the keyfile. If it is, generate a dataframe as above, but without filtering motion or surface codes.

- Two information event dataframes are created: bad_info_df consisting of powerlines and bridge events, and good_info_df consisting of TP (turning points). Get ride of the bad data, and if the resulting data frame has no lines, the toolbox will print that the filename bonked.

- If there are no lines in the good_info_df, then we are done and the munged GNSS data frame is written to a csv in the GNSS output directory.

- If there are turning points, the GNSS file must be split at the beginning of the new good data. Split GNSS files following calval naming conventions, with an additional number indicating number of file splits at the end.

- Finally, the munged data frames are written to a csv in the GNSS output directory with the following fields:

| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| gnss_Lat	| WGS84 |
| gnss_Lon	| WGS84 |
| gnss_wse	| Water surface elevation relative to the provided model of the geoid in meters |
| gnss_time_tai	| Seconds since January 1 2000 at midnight without leap seconds |
| gnss_uncertainty_m	| In meters, only values < 0.05 m |
| gnss_surf_flag	| Should be 12, indicating quality data over water |
| gnss_motion_flag	| Should be 2, indicating moving data collection |
| height_above_ellipsoid | Height of the water level with respect to the reference ellipsoid in meters |
| gnss_time_UTC	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss 24 hour format |
| gnss_ellipsoid | ellipsoid_semi_major_axis, ellipsoid_flattening |
| drift_id	| Munged drifts/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd/SWOTCalVal_campaignshortname_GNSS_L2_instrumentname_startdatetime_enddatetime |

## Correct PTs to GNSS

**Only correct PTs to GNSS occupies**

Error thresholds for data:

**Distance threshold:** 150 meters, PT must be within a 150 m radius of a GNSS drift

**Time threshold:** 900 seconds (15 minutes), centered around PT collect, so 15 minutes before and after

**GNSS standard deviation:** 0.05 meters, how much variance is allowed in GNSS data when it is within the distance threshold

**Offset standard deviation:** 0.10 meters, how much variance is allowed in PT data from put in to take out. This is currently turned off

**Change threshold over 15 minutes:** 0.15 meters, does it change more than 15cm in 15 minutes? If so, that is a discontinuity in offset

**Dry threshold:** 0.10 meters, this is a raw PT level where anything below is considered a PT out of water

***These should eventually be specific to each river and are subject to change/should be up for debate!***

- First, check for un-munged csv PT L1 data in the PT data directory that have not already been processed. If there are, then run the correct_pt_to_gnss_only function.

- Read in the key file, fill blank cells with NA, and check that number of columns and names are correct.

- The correct_pt_to_gnss_only function reads in the raw PT files and the PT key files and IDs PTs based on their serial numbers. Check to make sure that the PTs in the key file exist and the csv files contain data. There are 11 lines of headers to skip when creating PT data frames in csv format. The PT data should log at 15min intervals and must be mutated to the standard POSIXct UTC time.

- The correct PT key file to join to the PT data is selected by the install and uninstall (in the water) time, which is always in the PT record. If the PT record is much shorter than expected, this is likely due to a mismatch between baro-corrected PT times and keyfile times.

- The last step in data tidying is to merge PT files with the PT key file with a left join based on PT serial number, filtered to times when the PT was in the water (install and uninstall dates, and above the dry PT threshold).

- Next up, come the actual corrections to the PT data to get water surface elevation. First, check to make sure the key file is properly joined to the PT data and there is data in the cleaned PT files, if not return NA. Also check to see if there are any shifts in the PT data (defined by the change_thresh_15_min), if there are flag the data with 1.

- Filter the PT data to the time of the GNSS install and uninstall, if both are available or just get the GNSS install data time. If there are no GNSS data files linked in the keyfile, bonk.

- Read in the munged L2 GNSS drift data and mutate the datetime into Râs POSIXct format. If an L2 GNSS file doesn't exist, check on push/pull GNSS from JPL.

- Do an inner join of the PT and GNSS data by datetime, applying the site-specific time threshold, data are limited to within the install and uninstall time frames. For example, with a threshold of 15 minutes, all GNSS data at 1 Hz within 30 minutes of every PT observation will be pulled.

- Multiple GNSS points go to one PT observation, so group the PT by occupy_id and create the offset correction of GNSS water surface elevation minus the PT level (both in meters).

- To create the PT corrections, PT level and the PT offset correction are added together and then joined to the PT data frame with a left join.

- Error is summarized in multiple ways. The PT correction total error is the standard deviation of the wse (boat bobbing) and the GNSS average error, propagated. The PT correction offset standard deviation and total error due to GNSS error are also summarized. The time difference between PT and GNSS measurements are also stored.

- At this point, there should be either 1 or 2 final offset corrections (depending on if there was both an install and uninstall). Check to make sure there are not more than 2 or 0 rows in the final_offset_df, if either statement is true return an error message.

- PT flag descriptions:
  - 0: all good
  - 1: shift in raw PT (15cm in 15min)
  - 10: no uninstall data
  - 1000: (install - uninstall) > threshold

- Finally, take the mean of the final_offset_df to get a singular PT offset and use a left join to add the offset and associated error estimates to the PT data. Apply the final PT offset to the pt_level to get PT wse filtered to when the PT was in the water.

- The last step is to print out the filename and âthis file has passed all checksâ and write a csv of the final PT data saved to the QA QC PT output directory with the following fields:

## Flyby offsets ##

- The correct_PT_via_flyby function takes PTs flagged as problematic from the correct_PT_to GNSS_occupy_only and attempts to correct PT level to wse by using GNSS data from passing drifts within a set time and distance threshold. Output is stored in Flyby PT/reprocessed_yyyy_mm_dd.

Error thresholds for data:

**GNSS standard deviation:** 0.05 meters, how much variance is allowed in GNSS data when it is within the distance threshold

**Time threshold:** 450 seconds (7.5 minutes), centered around PT collect, so 7.5 minutes before and after

**Distance threshold:** 150 meters, PT must be within a 150 m radius of a GNSS drift

- If the PT is flagged as 0 (good) or 1 (shift in raw data), do not run the correct_PT_via_flyby function and return a corrected PT dataframe with NA for flyby correction fields.

- Read in all of the river's GNSS data and return a list of all GNSS files that fall within the PT record by datetime. If there are multiple versions of a GNSS file, take the most recent reprocessing date.

- Create a bounding box of the GNSS max/min lat/lon and check to see if the PT is within the box. If so, join the PT and GNSS data with a difference inner join by datetime with a max distance based on the time threshold. A column with the seconds between the GNSS and PT measurements is added.

- Take the dataframe of PT paired with GNSS by time (pt_with_gnss_time) and calculate a distance vector with the pairwise difference between every row's GNSS and PT using a haversine. Join the distance vector to the pt_with_gnss_time dataframe and filter by the distance threshold.

- Calculate a flyby offset for the dataframe (gnss_wse-pt_level), making sure there is greater than the minimum number of GNSS points to create an offset



## Calculate slopes and heights from drifts within nodes and reaches

- Read in the river-specific SWORD reach data and pull all river reach and node IDs. Set the UTM zone and define a buffer of 50 m to extend the reach.

- Run the calculate_slope_wse_fromdrift function. First, set up a function to project latitude and longitude into UTMs.

- Bring in SWORD data in the netCDF format and index the reach and node IDs for the specific river.

For node variables, create a data frame with the following fields:
| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| lon	| Node longitude in UTM |
| lat	| Node latitude in UTM |
| node_id	| Unique node ID |
| node_wmax	| Max node width, in m |
| node_length	| Node length, in m |
| reach_id	| Reach ID that node falls in |

For reach variables, create a data frame with the following fields:
| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| lon	| Central reach longitude UTM |
| lat	| Central reach latitude UTM |
| reach_id	| Unique reach ID |
| reach_xmax	| Max longitude UTM |
| reach_xmin	| Min longitude UTM |
| reach_ymax	| Max latitude UTM |
| reach_ymin	| Min latitude UTM |
| reach_length | Length, in m |

- For both of these processes overwriting the original indexes limits the amount of RAM needed.

Bring in the SWORD centerlines in netCDF format for the specific river and create a data frame with the following variables:
| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| reach_id	| Reach ID for centerline |
| lon	| Centerline longitude UTM |
| lat	| Centerline latitude UTM |
| cl_id	| Centerline ID |
| cl_node_id	| Centerline node ID |

### Calculate node water surface elevation

- Read in the GNSS drift csv file and convert the latitude and longitude to UTMs and the time to POSIXct UTC.

- Join the centerline data frame to the node data frame using a left join and compute the angle that the centerline intersects each node at. Using that node angle, make a polygon geometry of four points centered around the node that are spaced out the maximum width and length of the node. Convert the points into a box for each node that is a spatial object. Eventually this process could be replaced with aerial imagery to delineate the water extent. 

- Make the GNSS drift data a spatial object and find the intersection between the node boxes and drift points. Group these points by node ID and then take the mean of all GNSS water surface elevation points within the boxes as the mean node water surface elevation (in meters). Compute the mean GNSS time for all drift data within the box and save the reach ID, drift ID, and node water surface elevation precision as 0.05 m.

### Calculate reach water surface elevation and slope from drifts

- Read in the GNSS drift csv file and convert the latitude and longitude to UTMs and the time to POSIXct UTC.

- Create an index of relevant drift data that that is within each reach, then for each reach calculate the mean GNSS water surface elevation (in meters), save the reach water surface elevation precision as 0.05 m, water surface elevation start time, and water surface elevation end time.

- Search for centerline points within the buffer distance of the top and bottom of each reach to define the slope and pull the length of each reach.

- Match GNSS drift data to the centerline points at the top and bottom of the reaches through a geospatial search.

- To calculate the slope, take the mean of the water surface elevations at the top of the reach over the buffer area minus the mean of the water surface elevations at the bottom of the reach over the buffer area divided by the length of the centerline. Calculate the standard deviation of the slope as the uncertainty metric and save all outputs to a data frame.

- If the whole reach wasnât floated, donât compute the slope. If the slope doesnât exist for a reach get rid of the water surface elevation, because water surface elevation should be averaged over an entire reachâs worth of data.

- From these calculations, there are three csv files saved into the node and reach output directories, respectively:

Node water surface outputs saved as ârivernameâ _drift_node_wses:

| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| node_id	| Unique SWORD node ID |
| node_wse	| Node water surface elevation, in meters |
| node_wse_precision_m	| In meters, instrument error, 0.05 m |
| time	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
| reach_id	| Unique SWORD reach ID |
| drift_id | Following calval naming conventions |

Node geometry is saved as a csv with node id and geometry.

Reach water surface elevation and slope as ârivernameâ _drift_reach_wse_slope:
| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| reach_id	| Unique SWORD reach ID |
| wse_bar	| Water surface elevation, in meters |
| wse_precision	| In meters, instrument error, 0.05 m |
| wse_start	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
| wse_end	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
| slope	| |
| slope_precision	| Standard deviation |
| driftÂ¬_id	| Following calval naming conventions |

### Calculate slopes and heights from PTs within nodes and reaches

- Bring in the munged PTs, the key file, and SWORD reaches and nodes for the river of interest. Next, run the calculate_slope_wse_fromPT function.

- Make a data frame with the key file and munged PTs by a left join.

- To calculate node water surface elevation, group the PT data frame by node ID and find the mean water surface elevation (in meters) for each node. Set the mean PT water surface precision to 0.001 m, the error of the PT instruments.

- To calculate reach water surface elevation, group the PT data frame by reach ID and find the mean water surface elevation (in meters) for each reach. Set the mean PT water surface precision to 0.001 m, the error of the PT instruments.

- To calculate slope, group PT data by upstream and downstream reach IDs and average water surface elevation over these variables. Uncertainty is the standard deviation of PT water surface elevations at the upstream and downstream reaches.  Slope is the mean upstream water surface elevation minus the mean downstream water elevation divided by reach length, segmented by time.

- From these calculations, there are three csv files saved into the node and reach output directories, respectively:

PT node water surface elevation:

| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| node_id	 | SWORD node ID |
| pt_time_UCT	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
| mean_node_wse_m	| Mean node water surface elevation in meters |
| mean_pt_wse_precision_m	| In meters, instrument error, 0.001 m |

PT reach water surface elevation:

| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| reach_id	| SWORD reach ID |
| pt_time_UCT	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
| mean_reach_wse_m	| Mean reach water surface elevation, meters |
| mean_pt_wse_precision_m	| In meters, instrument error, 0.001 m |

PT reach slope:

| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| reach_id	| SWORD reach ID |
| pt_time_UCT	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
| slope	| Slope |
| slope_precision	| Standard deviation of PT measurements |

## Define what drift goes with what SWOT overpass

*Right now, this is set up with a fake SWOT pass ID and time.*

Define thresholds for linking GNSS drifts to SWOT overpasses:

**Time threshold:** Two hours

**Water surface elevation threshold:** Within 5cm

**Distance threshold:** Within 200m

***These will be specific to each river and are subject to change/should be up for debate!***

- Next, run the select_appropriate_drift function. 

- First, read in the node water surface elevation csv, convert time to POSTIXct, and calculate the time to SWOT overpass.

- Make an index of what drift node observations to keep and remove based on the time threshold.

- For node water surface elevations from drifts within the time threshold, add the time of the SWOT overpass and the SWOT pass ID to a direct match data frame and save to a csv of SWOT drift pairs.

- For drifts outside of the time threshold get the drift data at 1 Hz.

- Pull the PT levels at the time of the SWOT overpass from the munged PT csv.

- Next, compare the drift node levels with the PT levels with a difference join based on latitude and longitude: (This process is slow.)

- Read in the PT key file. Join the drift and PT data using a nearest neighbor haversine geospatial left join. Compute the difference in water surface elevation between the GNSS and PT data. Then join the key file to the data frame with a left join. Next, filter the data by the distance threshold.

- This data frame has now found all drifts within the distance threshold of the PTs.

- Next, filter by water level within the water surface elevation threshold to find âgoodâ matches of PT and drift data.

Group by node and drift ID before computing summary statistics to be output in the final csv data frame of SWOT drift pairs:

| Variable	| Description |
|----------|--------------|
| node_id	| SWORD node ID |
| drift_id	| Following calval naming conventions |
| drift_pt_dist_km_bar	| Distance from drift to PT in km |
| wse_difference_m_bar | Water surface elevation difference between drift and PT, in meters |
| wse_difference_m_sd	| Standard deviation of water surface elevation difference, in meters |
| swot_passid	| Fake swot pass (for now!) |
| swot_time_UTC	| yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss format |
